/// Representation of an Archive.
///
/// Because this is generic, it can represent things like a directory on disk,
/// allowing us to convert an Ark of on-disk files into an Ark of imported files
/// in a simple, high-performance way. It obviates the need for things like a
/// stream API, and allows for a lot of tests to be done in-memory without disk.
///
/// The underlying format is an SOA approach, which you can inspect with:
///
///   - ark.paths()
///   - ark.attrs()
///   - ark.contents()
///
/// These three channels are implemented as immutable, reference-counted
/// vectors. This is great for memory hygiene! Almost every possible
/// transformation you'd ever want to do on an Ark will leave one or two
/// channels unchanged, and create a new vector for the stuff that _is_
/// changing.
